# Typing Speed Tester

A web-based typing speed tester that allows users to test and improve their typing speed. This app presents random sample texts for users to type, measures their typing speed in words per minute (WPM), and provides real-time feedback on typing accuracy.

## Features

- **Randomized Texts**: The app randomly selects a sample text from a predefined list.
- **Typing Feedback**: As users type, the app highlights correct characters in green, incorrect characters in red, and untyped characters in grey.
- **WPM Calculation**: After completing the text, the app calculates and displays the user's words per minute (WPM).
- **Restart Option**: Users can restart the test at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and feedback.
- **JavaScript**: For logic such as starting, restarting the test, and calculating typing speed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start the Typing Speed Tester.
3. Optionally, you can serve the project locally using a web server.

## How to Use

1. **Start Test**: Click the "Start" button to begin the typing test. A random text will appear.
2. **Type the Text**: Start typing the text in the textarea provided. The app will provide real-time feedback on your typing accuracy.
3. **See Results**: Once you type the entire text correctly, the app will display your words per minute (WPM).
4. **Restart**: If you'd like to try again, click the "Restart" button to clear the text and results.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML structure of the app.
- **styles.css**: Contains the styles and layout.
- **script.js**: Contains the logic for starting the test, calculating WPM, and providing real-time feedback.

## Example of Use

1. Click "Start".
2. Type the text that appears in the text area.
3. Once you've finished typing the entire text, the app will display your typing speed in WPM.

## Troubleshooting

- **Test Not Starting**: Make sure the JavaScript file (`script.js`) is linked properly in the HTML.
- **Real-Time Feedback Not Showing**: Ensure that your browser supports JavaScript and that the script is running without errors in the console.
